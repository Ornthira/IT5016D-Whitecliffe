#exaple code halfway down taken for inspiration from a stack overflow discussion about why someone's code wasn't working.
#I found this quite insightful really early on as I made think learn about identifying issues within my own codes.
#the original code was: 

# def mainmenu():
#    print ('1. Scan')
#    print ('2. Ping')
#    print ('3. Exit')
#    print

#    choice = int(raw_input('> Enter your choice: '))

#   if choice == 1:
#      print ('Starting Scan\n')
#      mainmenu()
#   elif choice == 2:
#      print ('Starting Ping\n')
#      mainmenu()
#   elif choice == 3:
#       print ('Exiting\n')
#       exit(0)
#mainmenu()
#some kind soul suggested the following:
def mainmenu():
    while(True):
        print ('1. Scan')
        print ('2. Ping')
        print ('3. Exit')
        print

        choice = int(input('> Enter your choice: '))

    
        if choice == 1:
            print ('Starting Scan\n')
        elif choice == 2:
            print ('Starting Ping\n')
        elif choice == 3:
            print ('Exiting\n')
            exit(0)
mainmenu()
