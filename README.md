IT5016D Software Development Fundamentals. 
This repository contains a collection of practice codes and example codes taken for inspiration to help me along my journey as an emering devloper :) 

Unfortunely, I have not figured out how to make folders even after searching the internet for an answer. I hope that you will still find it easy enough to navigate with the help of the "practice" and "inspiration" name labels.
As this is the first time I have made a readme.md file, and I had started it prior to scanning the internet about readme.md files it's apperance is very simple. 

I hope that with time and practice I will be able to develop good documentation skills. A fantastic page I found for learning more about creating .md files while creating one for my software development project that helped me alot is https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/markdown.html
